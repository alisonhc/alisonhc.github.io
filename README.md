# About

I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh ([ILCC](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/ilcc)) supervised by [Emily Allaway](https://emilyallaway.github.io/). I'm interested in how we express and interpret implied meaning in language, and to what extent language models can reason about it.
